                Hello, my name is Chase Tegtmeier McCracken. I’m a student at the University of South Carolina 
                studying computer science. I’m passionate about learning new things that I haven't seen before
                 in tech and playing football at the University of South Carolina. My goal is to find and grow
                 my passion in the tech industry and learn new things.

                    While there are many different backpacks that are available, there is a lack of
                    compact, stylish, and versatile options that are designed specifically to meet 
                    the daily needs of young adults.

                <p>This description is the affinity diagram on backpacks and how I would improve them 
                    to versatile backpacks versus the now unappealing backpacks I did this using 6 clusters 
                    and 20 sticky notes.

                <p>These sketches are three different designs from how apps started off to what I'm hoping 
                    to make a now modern app and then futuristic app's storyboard as well as how the layout 
                    and feel would look.
