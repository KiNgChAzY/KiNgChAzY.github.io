        <p>In CSCE242 Web Applications, we learn how to build 
            websites and make them interactive. We use HTML to 
            create the structure of web pages and CSS to style. 
            We add JavaScript to make things happen when 
            users click buttons or fill out forms. As well we 
            learn how to build the back end of a website using 
            server-side code like database so By the end, we 
            have build a full web application that shows 
            everything we've learned.
